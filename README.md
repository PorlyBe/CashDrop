# Cash Drop
Bitcoin Cash Mempool Visualiser

This is my first public JavaScript project. It was designed to help me learn JavaScript.

The initial idea came from BitBonkers. I liked this visualiser but is not Bitcoin Cash, so I decided to make my own.

The graphics & physics use BabylonJS & Cannon.

New transactions and blocks are received using Socket.io with cashexplorer.bitcoin.com.

Coin texture was designed by Mjbmonetarymetals and was found in the this bitcoin.com forum post.

Skybox texture comes from 3DElyvisions.

Sound is from feesounds.com
